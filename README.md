# FIFA World Cup 2022 Competion

An app for competing with my friends in who'll guess the most game scores at FIFA World Cup and become the ultimate champion :) 

## Technical Side

The app is built with Next.js and Firebase.

It uses FIFA's API to get all matches, and Firebase for auth and to store the user's prediction. After the match is finished, users get points based on the result they guessed and move up or down in the table.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
